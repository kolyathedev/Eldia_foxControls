# Originally a final lesson, I think lesson 23, template from Three.js Journey by Bruno Simon https://threejs-journey.com/

## Overview

I have tried to implement a set of controls to animate and move any gltf object
with an updating camera, target etc.

```bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```
